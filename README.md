## Troubleshooting

### "Model Status Unknown" or "Model Unavailable"

- Ensure you're using Chrome 138 or higher
- Check that the required flags are enabled in `chrome://flags`
- Verify your system meets the hardware requirements (22GB storage, 4GB+ VRAM)
- Visit `chrome://on-device-internals` to check model status

### "Model needs to be downloaded"

- Click "Tailor Now" to initiate the download (requires user gesture)
- First download requires ~22GB storage and may take 10-30 minutes
- Ensure you have an unmetered (unlimited) internet connection
- Check download progress in the Model Status card

### "Failed to parse PDF"

- Only text-based PDFs are supported (not scanned images)
- Password-protected PDFs cannot be parsed
- Try exporting your resume as a fresh PDF
- Very complex layouts may have text extraction issues

### "No output language was specified" Warning

- This should be resolved in v1.3.0
- If you still see it, try reloading the extension
- Check that you're using the latest version

### Generation Produces Poor Results

- Ensure JD has at least 100 characters
- Provide resume bullets for better context
- Try different tone settings
- Click "Regenerate" for variations
- More detailed JDs produce better results

### Extension Won't Load

- Check that all files are present (especially `lib/pdf.mjs` and `lib/pdf.worker.mjs`)
- Run `download-pdfjs.ps1` if pdf.js files are missing
- Check Chrome DevTools console for errors
- Try reloading the extension from `chrome://extensions/`
