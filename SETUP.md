# üßµ Jobweave - Setup Guide

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get Jobweave running and start tailoring your resume:

### Step 1: Enable Chrome AI Features

1. Open Chrome and type `chrome://flags` in the address bar
2. Search for and enable these flags:

   - **Optimization Guide On Device Model** (`#optimization-guide-on-device-model`) - Set to "Enabled"
   - **Text Safety Classifier** (`#text-safety-classifier`) - Set to "Enabled"
   - **Summarizer API** (if available, search "summarizer") - Set to "Enabled"

3. Click "Relaunch" to restart Chrome

**Note**: The Summarizer API is the core requirement. Writer/Rewriter/Proofreader APIs are optional and in origin trial.

### Step 2: Verify Chrome Version

1. Go to `chrome://settings/help`
2. Ensure you have Chrome 138 or higher
3. If not, update Chrome to the latest version

### Step 3: Download PDF.js Library (Required for PDF Upload)

The extension needs the pdf.js library to parse PDF resumes:

1. Open PowerShell in the extension directory
2. Run: `.\download-pdfjs.ps1`
3. This downloads pdf.js (~2.4 MB) to the `lib/` folder
4. Required for the PDF resume upload feature

**Note**: If icons are missing, run the `create-icons.ps1` script in the `icons/` folder.

### Step 4: Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Navigate to and select the `Resume Editor` directory (or wherever you cloned the repo)
5. Click "Select Folder"

You should see "Jobweave" appear in your extensions list with a üßµ icon.

### Step 5: First Time Setup - Model Download

When you first use the extension:

1. Click the Jobweave (üßµ) icon in Chrome's toolbar
2. The extension will check if Gemini Nano is available
3. You'll see one of these statuses:

   - **Model Ready** ‚úÖ - You're good to go!
   - **Model Download Required** üì¶ - Click "Tailor Now" to start download
   - **Model Unavailable** ‚ùå - Check system requirements

4. If download is needed:

   - Requires ~22GB of free storage
   - Takes 10-30 minutes (depends on internet speed)
   - Progress shown in the Model Status card
   - **Must use unmetered internet connection**

5. Monitor download at `chrome://on-device-internals`

**Important**:

- First "Tailor Now" click initiates download (user gesture required)
- Keep Chrome open during download
- Extension will work offline after model is downloaded

### Step 6: Test the Extension

**Basic Test:**

1. Click the Jobweave icon
2. Paste a job description (or click "Capture from current page" on a job posting)
3. Optionally: Upload a PDF resume or paste some bullets
4. Click "üéØ Tailor Now"
5. Wait for AI to generate tailored bullets and cover letter
6. Click copy buttons to use the results

**PDF Upload Test:**

1. Click "üìÑ Upload Resume (PDF)"
2. Select your resume PDF
3. Text should appear in the resume text area
4. Use it for tailoring

**Side Panel Test:**

1. Right-click the Jobweave icon ‚Üí "Options" or use Chrome menu
2. Select "Open Side Panel"
3. Work with larger input areas while browsing jobs

## Troubleshooting

### "Model Status Unknown" or Stuck on "Checking..."

### "Model needs to be downloaded" Message

- Ensure you have 22GB+ free storage
- Use unmetered (unlimited) internet connection
- Click "üéØ Tailor Now" to start download (requires user click)
- Check progress at `chrome://on-device-internals`
- Download may take 10-30 minutes

### "Failed to parse PDF"

- Only text-based PDFs supported (not scanned images)
- Remove password protection from PDF
- Try exporting resume as fresh PDF
- Check that `lib/pdf.mjs` and `lib/pdf.worker.mjs` exist
- Re-run `download-pdfjs.ps1` if files missing

### Extension Won't Load

- Verify all files are present, especially:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `popup.js`, `popup.html`, `sidepanel.html`
  - `lib/pdf.mjs` and `lib/pdf.worker.mjs`
- Check DevTools console for errors: `chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Inspect views
- Try removing and re-loading the extension

### "No output language was specified" Warning

- Should be fixed in v1.3.0
- If persists, reload extension
- Check you're using latest version
- Warning doesn't affect functionality

### Generation Produces Poor Results

- Provide more detailed job description (100+ characters minimum)
- Add your resume bullets for better context
